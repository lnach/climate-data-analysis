# Global Climate Data Analysis

**Team Project:** STOR 320 (Methods and Models of Data Science) - Fall 2025  
**Team Members:** Clay Grant, Austin Hill, Luke Nachnani, Abrihim Bolisetty

## Overview
Analysis of 30+ years of climate data exploring correlations between greenhouse gases, global temperatures, and sea level changes. We used Python, statistical modeling, and time-series analysis to identify relationships between environmental variables.

## Files
- **[Final_Report_STOR_320.pdf](Final_Report_STOR_320.pdf)** - Complete analysis writeup with findings and visualizations
- **[climate_analysis.ipynb](climate_analysis.ipynb)** - Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, EDA, and modeling code

## Key Technologies
Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels

## Key Findings
- Built regression model explaining 60% of temperature variance (R² = 0.60)
- Identified strong correlations (r ≈ 0.90) between greenhouse gas index (AGGI) and land temperatures
- Sea level rises approximately 65.5mm for every 1°C increase in global land temperature
- Vector autoregression model revealed 1-2 year lag between CO₂ emissions and sea level response
